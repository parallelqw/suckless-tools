# suckless-tools

Here is my fork of suckless tools.

I didn't include tabbed, i was using but not actively.

I am using xfce4-terminal instead of st. Because it was missing some features that i hardly need.

I will not post a screenshot here, go ahead and try it yourself.

It is mostly updated change-by-change.

# Plans:
+++ use tcc instead of cc

++ make tags look more beatiful -

+++ try to find a better font 

try to fix st or search for a new minimalist terminal -
